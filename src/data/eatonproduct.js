This RCD/MCB combination PKNM switch is not only available as an AC and pulse current sensitive standard type A, but also as a mixing frequency sensitive type F, as a type G or G/A triggering with a time delay of at least 10 ms. While the AC and the A are only impulse current resistant up to 250 A, the other three types F, G and G/A offer an increased impulse current resistance of more than 3 kA.",

A tripping by a fault current is signalled by the blue display, white indicates that either the MCB part was tripped or that it was switched off. It is compatible with Busbars. A twin-purpose terminal (lift/open-mouthed) is available for easy and quick mounting.",
